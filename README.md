# Testing a toy example of using a json schema for generating json outputs
Notebook runs 3 different models at multiple temperatures for two json schemas, one slightly more complicated than the other. 

# Conclusions

- mini struggles with more complicated json schemas - seeing schema in json output
- gpt-4o reliable at low temps, also struggles at higher temperatures
- simpler schemas are unproblematic for all models
